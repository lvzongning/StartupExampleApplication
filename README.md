StartupExampleApplication
=========================

an android application starts automatically after device boot finished


After android device is booted, 
we start the app
and 
view a web page in webview with fullscreen mode.

For Android 4+ versions tablets, we are unable to hide status bar completely 
but it works fine with phones.
